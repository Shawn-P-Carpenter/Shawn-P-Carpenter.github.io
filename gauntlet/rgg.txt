Retro Game Gauntlet

Inspired by a challenge /vr/ used to run

Rules:

- Roll a game for each console
- Compete the game with a screenshot
	- If game is hiscore based(no completion possible), then you must beat the games hiscore for hardest mode or if thats really easy set a goal to beat
- If game offers diffuculty selection then you must play on at least normal
- No using cheats, save states, rewind, etc.
- No using walkthroughs, guides, or googling, retro games are complicated and often confusing but thats part of the challenge
- Reroll only if game is impossible to emulate(there are some games that would require accessories impossible to emulate)
- If you truly give up on a game(only do this if there is 100% no way you beat it) then you go back one square and do one for that
	- You can reroll NES if you give up on that, but you need to wait 3 days to reroll NES again(this is to prevent just spam rerolling NES without consequence)
- If the game is impossible to technically complete(something like animal crossing/the sims for example) look up if there is some kind of final goal to complete or else just reroll
- Including japanese games is up to you, certain consoles(turbografx and saturn) have much bigger jp libraries but you run the risk of getting something you cant understand or a visual novel of some kind
